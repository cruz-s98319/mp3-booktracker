# Milestone Project 3
For this Milestone Project, I decided to create a Book tracker website. The user will be able to add the book title, author, and genre to a form. Once they submit it, it will then be added to a list. It will be marked as "Reading" by default, later on the user will be able to mark it as "Complete".
